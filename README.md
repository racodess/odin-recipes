# odin-recipes
This is a learning project intended to cover HTML and CSS. Emphasis was placed on Git CLI best practices, including atomic commits and good commit messages.

The goal was to create a barebones recipe website with links to three recipes. At minimum, each recipe was to have an image, description, a list of ingredients, followed by a list of steps to make the recipe.
