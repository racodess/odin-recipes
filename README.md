# odin-recipes
This is a learning project intended to put everything covered in the "Git Basics" and "HTML Foundations" lessons to practice.

Overall, this project covered HTML and CSS. Emphasis was placed on Git CLI best practices, including atomic commits and good commit messages.

The goal was to create a barebones recipe website with links to three recipes. At minimum, each recipe was to have an image, description, a list of ingredients, followed by a list of steps to make the recipe.
