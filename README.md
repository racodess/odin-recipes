# odin-recipes
The first project in The Odin Project's foundations course.

This is a learning project intended to put everything covered in the "Git Basics" and "HTML Foundations" lessons to practice.

Overall, this project covered very basic HTML without CSS. Emphasis was placed on Git CLI best practices, including atomic commits and good commit messages.

The goal was to create a barebones recipe website with links to three recipes. At minimum, each recipe was to have an image, description, a list of ingredients, followed by a list of steps to make the recipe.

Very quick and easy. Useful repetition of git best practices.
