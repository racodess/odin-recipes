					<p>Naan is a leavened, oven-baked (usually in a tandoor) flatbread, which is found in cuisines of Iran, Afghanistan, Central Asia, the Indian subcontinent, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, and the Caribbean.</p>
					<p>Homemade naan bread is soft, chewy, and simply delicious. It's an easy side, perfect for pairing with any meal.</p>

					<h2>Steps</h2>
					<ol>
						<li>Combine warm water, yeast, and sugar in a large bowl; let sit for five minutes or till bubbly. Add olive oil, yogurt, egg, salt, and 2 cups of flour to the yeast mixture. Stir until smooth. You can use a wooden spoon or an electric mixer with dough hook attachments.</li>
						<li>Add enough flour to make a soft dough. Knead a few times on a floured counter until smooth.</li>
						<li>Place dough in a greased bowl. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled.</li>
						<li>Preheat a skillet to medium heat. Cut dough into eight pieces. On a lightly floured surface, roll out each piece into a 6â€³ circle. </li>
						<li>Add a little oil or non-stick spray to the skillet on medium-high heat. Cook each circle for 2-3 minutes or until bubbly and golden brown on the bottom. Flip over and cook for another 2-3 minutes.</li>
						<li>Brush the top (the bubbly side) of each naan with melted butter. I added garlic to my butter, in order to make more of a garlic naan, but that is optional.</li>
